My first experience with this company was whole beaned. I really enjoyed the flavor the first time and was hoping this next bag would also taste great.</p><p>I really didn't know anything about the company when I purchased or drank the coffee. I just checked and it's a supermarket! Now this makes me feel stupid. Not that I am drinking and liking supermarket coffee from Italy but because it just hit me that the place we bought this from was called Essulunga!</p><p>We even had espressos and some strawberry dessert thing while we were there. We took the train from the Milan airport down just one stop and then walked till we found a supermarket. We wanted to bring home coffee and chocolates. We even were dragging our luggage with us!</p><p>Now back to the coffee. The coffee was purchased in May in Milan yet still maintained its freshness. The thing with most of these coffees is that the favors don't necessarily pop out at you. It's a great blend of a variety of coffees as an Italian roast.</p><p>It's very smooth with no bitterness detected. My next trip to Milan may require another stop at Esselunga.</p><p>I would also like to point out that this coffee would have been under €2. Great deal!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 5, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
