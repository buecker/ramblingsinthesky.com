They are HUGE compared to a normal mosquito. Just learned today from this article in <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cdc-issues-warning-about-painful-virus-mosquitoes-2D11765769">nbcnews.com</a> that the mosquito may carry the dengue virus. Not only that virus but I guess a new virus from Africa as well. According to the article, <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/www.cdc.gov/chikungunya">Chikungunya virus</a>is also a very painful virus to get. It was found in Sint Maartin.</p><p>I am including a shot of one here but I may have to take a picture with my camera when I see another one. Fortunately, we have lots of geckos in the house and they do an amazing job of eating the bugs.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Aedes_Albopictus.jpg" alt="Asian Tiger Mosquitos" width="1080" height="733" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 20, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
