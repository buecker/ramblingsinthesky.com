I am reposting some of the original content. I thought it would be fun to keep this one. We are going back to New Zealand for our 3rd time. This coming trip will be spent in Queenstown on the South Island.</p><p>This is just a short blurb about vacation. We recently got back from visiting Phoenix, Los Angeles, Tahiti, and Auckland, New Zealand.</p><ol><li>Tahiti was beautiful but not that much different than our own Caribbean islands. We went to Moorea for a day trip and that island is just stunning.</li><li>Getting to see even just one spring training game is awesome. I'm glad we go every year. This year we had to be at LAX the next day to fly out and so we drove to Los Angeles. The sunset was amazing. TuneIn radio worked 95% of the time and I would highly recommend it but just once.</li><li>New Zealand was even more beautiful than I expected and Auckland was an extremely modern city. I got to try a Flat White for the first time and just fell in love with the drink. We also went to Wahiki island off of Auckland and that provided us with even more beauty. Especially since we walked most of it. The wineries everywhere were top-notch.</li><li>A layover in Tahiti and Los Angeles on the way back wasn't too bad. In Tahiti, they took my travel corkscrew. First time in over 5 years I have had it taken on me and this was obviously my 2nd time in that airport! For Los Angeles, we just drove around near the water and checked out some of the scenery.</li></ol><p>I think sums it up. I have some amazing pictures and memories and very happy to have had the opportunity to take this trip.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 20, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
