Guess there is no auto-save feature? I will have to check that out.</p><p>Lets see if I can shorten this:</p><p>Ghost is a new blogging platform and I didn't really have the time (I technically still don't) to try and install it. It has taken a solid 1.5 hours to get it up and running on my little server but it seems to be working.</p><p>There are 2 possible issues. The first is I am not sure if I am saving this in mysql or sqlite. It is suppose to be mysql. The second is the upstart functionality. When I reboot my server I can't seem to verify ghost will restart. Again, this is something I will have to test later.</p><p>Lastly, this is being housed on an atom server running on Ubuntu 13.10.</p><p>I repurposed an Acer Veriton with an atom processor. Replaced the expensive fan and added an SSD and doubled the memory. It also serves as a remote desktop host with virtualbox running an XP guest. I also occasionally use it to stream video to the TV. It sits behind the TV and is silent. You may think that putting an SSD in it is overkill but when you are paying 52.5 cents (soon to go up another 2.5 cents) per Kwh you would also be doing everything to reduce your electricity costs.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 20, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
