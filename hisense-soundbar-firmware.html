Volume Down + Power. Hold it down until the light starts to flash.</p><p>My soundbar had two issues. The Hisense Soundbar would not turn off and after a few minutes it went super quiet. I did the standard troubleshooting and then opened a ticket with Hisense. It took them just a day or two to send a text message asking for a pic of the label. I originally did the chat support.</p><p>A week goes by and I reach out to them again. They say I have to ship it in. I did not have the original box but I did find a box it would fit in. However, it would have cost me close to $30 to ship it out.</p><p>The positive of this situation is either 1. don't buy hisense again (our tv is hisense also) or 2. thank heavens I don't have to pay to ship it back to get it fixed.</p><p>The negative is that Hisense support should have suggested I hit those two buttons. They did ask me to unplug and plug it back in.  This is huge mistake on their part. It would have cost them time and money to press those two buttons and ship it back. You know that's all they would have done.</p><p>The old saying "You get what you paid for" lives on. Here is verifiable proof.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 20, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
