I currently have a fitbit flex which is a hand-me-down. I bought one for my wife this past September and she just gave it to me after their company bought one for all their employees.</p><p>I like it but I don't like that we will be on our 3rd fitbit flex in just 3 full months. The one my wife got is also defective.</p><p><a href="http://www.razerzone.com/nabu">http://www.razerzone.com/nabu</a></p><p>5/2/2022</p><p>I've gone through three Wyze fitness bands and 2 Wzye watches since then.
