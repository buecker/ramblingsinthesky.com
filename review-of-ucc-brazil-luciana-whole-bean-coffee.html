It's my second whole bean bag of coffee that was purchased in Japan.</p><p>This particular bag was bought in a grocery store in Yokohama.</p><p>UCC Brazil Luciana might be the name of the coffee but all I know for sure is the company is called UCC. I found them on the web and they do have a place in Brazil. As far as purchasing more that I have no idea about it.</p><p>Let's get to what really matters. How does it taste? The answer to that question isn't very straightforward. It has a strong flavor but it's not actually bold. As a strong shot or as espresso it comes off with a tinge of bitterness with the complexities of chocolate. Sorry if it sounds weird but please don't let the word "bitterness" how you off. Think Starbucks burnt but without the aftertaste.</p><p>The beans were a dark French Roast and it was nowhere near my favorite espresso shot. However, as a latte it was amazing. For whatever scientific reason that I don't know, it became one of my favorites for homemade coffee drinks.</p><p>In the end I must say that I enjoy this coffee but keep in mind that it should be paired. It doesn't hold its own very well by itself.</p><p><em>Originally published on 11-15-2015.
