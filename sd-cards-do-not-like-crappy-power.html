I had hosted in the cloud for years but decided to shift it to the home. I've been paying for a static IP for many years and well, why not?</p><p>I do have several things going against me.</p><ol><li>Power<ol><li>Power is very expensive</li><li>Several power outages a month</li><li>Very poor power. Constant clicks and power spikes. Hard to hit 115V.</li><li>Hurricanes - When Irma hit we had no power for 90 days.</li><li>SD Cards do not like crappy power</li><li>Computer equipment does not like crappy power</li></ol></li><li>Hit and miss with the cable.<ol><li>Speeds fluctuate a lot but not really an issue.</li><li>Due to the power outages sometimes the cable network runs out of fuel. I have starlink for.a backup but haven't spend enough time figuring out how to combine the IPV6 address with Cloudflare to serve the site on IPV4.</li><li>High season is in the winter and the cable internet really degrades from all the tourists.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Even with all that I figured why not. This morning I had to do another FSCK on the sdcard. I am sure it was from the latest power outage. While I do use battery backups and surge protectors they don't do the greatest job. In this instance the PI is being ran from my POE+ Switch which is actually on a transfer switch. When the power goes out it switches to a pure sine inverter connected to a deep cycle marine battery. I have surge protector on it but I can't run another battery backup in-between.</p><p>Overall, I have ran a few FSCK to fix the sd card and the original sd card was a no-name brand that did not last. Either way when I compare to hosting it on AWS the PI has paid for itself. I really want to move some more sites over but I think I need to get some solar+battery installed before I tempt it.</p><p>My main "server" or in other words my old intel nuc that acts as a server appears to have a failing NIC. I was thinking I would upgrade that and then put proxmox on it. I already use several docker containers on it. If I do that then I feel like I do not know what I should use the PI for? It's a PI4 and I have PI5 sitting unused. I had to downgrade to a 8 port POE switch after my 24 port died. I got it replaced but I don't want to install it until I am fully moved over to solar+battery.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 26, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
