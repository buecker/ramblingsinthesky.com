Living in the tropics I could agree with that but I definitely make more when it is hot out. Especially with El Nino being back. Our lows have been around 80 for a month now. That should not happen until August/September. </p><p>What I do for my cold brew is use a cotton bag and make a mason jar worth of cold brew. I leave it to sit in the kitchen for around 20 hours. Three days worth goes to work with me on Monday and the rest is either drank by the wife or saved for the weekend.</p><p>I vary my recipe based on what I have. When I would make 10 gallons for special events I did a ratio of sweet, nutty and chocolatey.  PNG, Ethiopian, Brazil, Colombian and Guatamela are the usual countries. Currently, I have been using Mexican Chiapas, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and/or Colombian. The Chiapas I have right now is last season's crop. Got a great price on it. I can't taste the difference when using it in cold brew.</p><p>Enjoy a cold brew in this hot summer!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on June 25, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://ramblingsinthesky.com/authors/ben-uecker/" class="invert" rel="author">Ben Uecker</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header><ul></ul></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>Please don't forget your local non-profits.
